# Is-cooperation-favoured-by-horizontal-gene-transfer-

Supplementary code for Scott, West, Dewar and Wild (Evolution Letters, 2023).

This repository contains all code associated with the paper "Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?" 

Code is written for Matlab R2022a.

We prodide files for:

- Generating equilibrium genotype frequency values. 
                - This is provided in the "Script_to_generate_equilibrium_genotype_frequencies.m" script. 
                - The resulting data is also provided in the "Eq_Genotype_Freqs_N=20.mat" and "Eq_Genotype_Freqs_N=15.mat" files.

- Testing our relatedness expression with simulated data.
                - This is provided in the "Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.m" script.
                - The resulting data is also provided in the "Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.mat" file. 

- Generating all figures in the main text and supp info.
                - This is provided in the "Generate_Fig_....m" scripts.
